(Assume he owns the taxi)","The charges of a taxi journey are decided on the basis of the distance covered and the amount of the waiting time during a journey. Distance wise, for the first 2 kilometres (or any part thereof) of a journey, the metre reading is fixed at ` 10 (if there is no waiting). Also, if a taxi is boarded and it does not move, then the metre reading is again fixed at ` 10 for the first ten minutes of waiting. For every additional kilometre the metre reading changes by ` 5 (with changes in the metre reading being in multiples of ` 1 for every 200 metres travelled). For every additional minute of waiting, the metre reading changes by ` 1. (no account is taken of a fraction of a minute waited for or of a distance less than 200 metres travelled). The net metre reading is a function of the amount of time waited for and the distance travelled. The cost of running a taxi depends on the fuel efficiency (in terms of mileage/litre), depreciation (straight line over 10 years) and the driver’s salary (not taken into account if the taxi is self owned). Depreciation is ` 100 per day everyday of the first 10 years. This depreciation has to be added equally to the cost for every customer while calculating the profit for a particular trip.

Assume, for simplicity, that there are 50 customers every day (unless otherwise mentioned). The cost of fuel is ` 15 per litre (unless otherwise stated).
